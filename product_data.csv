<p>The Change Plate Storage has been a popular storage solution for our customers as it allows them to store all 3 kinds of change plates as well as clips, bands and other miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>This is the second version, the original had 1 peg up top for 2.5's and 2 pegs below for 5's and 10's we found that some brand plates cannot fit both 5 and 10 LBS plates next to each other so we flipped it upside down and now recommend to put the 10 LBS plates on bottom and the 2.5's and 5's on top.</p>
<p>Features 2 storage fingers on the back which are angled up at 3 degrees for more secure storage of clips, bands, chains, straps or any other item under 50 LBS.</p>
<p>The change plates storage allows you to store more weights without taking up as much space on the post, with two of the 3 pegs being off to the side of the rack post it leaves more holes above it open compared to using 3 separate pegs to store change plates.</p>

<p>The Belt squat attachment was designed to allow athletes who are injured or athletes who don't need the extra spine compression but still want to load the lower body for squats to gain strength.</p>
<p>Our Rack attached belt squat is not just for athletes with back issues, athletes with upper body issues that cannot hold a bar such as shoulder, arm, hand or even collar bone injuries can safely squat with the Stray Dog Strength Rack attached belt squat.</p>
<p>Comes with Spud INC Adjustable Belt Squat Belt</p>
<p>Our Belt Squat/Lat Pull Down combo unit is our only plate loaded machine attachment as many athletes squat more than 250 pounds.  With two 16"" weight pegs athletes can train with virtually any load they choose without compressing their spine and stress on the upper body.</p>
<p>The adjustable stop is necessary when using the belt squat as different height athletes will want to start and stop the weight at different heights to avoid awkward half reps. The adjustable stop should be removed while doing Lat pull downs as the trolley starts at the bottom and the stop is not needed.</p>

<p>Total alpha bench frame is 58"" x24.5"" in the back and 8"" wide in the front</p>
<p>The Alpha bench has 3 main features that make it stand out from the rest of the benches on the market. It is the only bench with the adjustment ladder on the back of the pad allowing for easier adjustment and a spotter plate to be where the ladder normally would be.</p>
<p>The Alpha bench has a lot of great features that make it stand out from other benches on the market, read our list below to better understand what makes the alpha bench special</p>
<p>The Premium pad has a steel back plate and comes with a non logo wear cover. The Standard pad is the same size as premium pad but without the steel back and wear cover.</p>
<p>1)Ladder Positions are cut into the back pad, not the frame. this allows for easier and quicker adjustments and is the only bench like this on the Market. All adjustment points are protected with plastic.</p>
<p>3) all adjustment points use bronze oil impregnated bushings allowing for smooth rotation and no metal on metal contact</p>
<p>4) 1.25"" pad gap when in flat position</p>
<p>5) laser cut angle degree marking on back and seat pads</p>
<p>6) urethane stray dog logoed wheels with abec 7 bearings for easy Movement of bench</p>
<p>7) rubber bumpers that grip the floor and Doesn't allow the bench to slide</p>
<p>8) Vertical storage that keeps the pad off the ground</p>
<p>9) knurled handle that is a piece of our power bar (28.5 mM Black powder coat, American made steel)</p>
<p>10) Back pad support has holes for rack attachments when seat is inclined</p>
<p>11) TWO TONE PAINT OPTIONS FRAME AND ACCENT</p>
<p>two tone paint Options, frame and accent (red frame, silver accent shown)</p>
<p>12) laser Cut stray dog name plate which is accent color</p>
<p>13) FRAME IS CONSTRUCTED ENTIRELY OUT OF 3X3 11 GAUGE</p>
<p>frame is constructed entirely out of 3x3 11 Gauge tubing</p>
<p>14) Optional logo spot for decals or laser cut logos which can be customized</p>
<p>15) optional spotter plate. as the ladder is on the back of the seat not the frame it allows us to put the spotter plate where the ladder would be. this makes the footprint smaller.</p>
<p>16) bolt together design that will allow for ups Parcel shipping which will keep shipping costs down</p>
